Requirements
============

Because the whole architecture has a lot of components we use Docker_ to manage the platform and isolates the services.

ALP has been developed to run on Ubuntu and has not been tested on other OS.

You should first `install Docker`_ and `install nvidia-docker`_, then play a bit with docker (check if you can access your GPU with nvidia-docker). You then you should be ready to install ALP.
